# 🐧 Penguin Species Prediction App

This project is a machine-learning powered web application that predicts the species of a **Palmer Penguin** based on its physical characteristics and habitat information. The system combines a trained classification model with an interactive web interface, allowing users to explore how different features influence species prediction in real time.

## 🚀 What This Project Does

The application allows users to input penguin characteristics such as:

- Island  
- Sex  
- Bill length and depth  
- Flipper length  
- Body mass  

Using these inputs, the system predicts which of the three Palmer penguin species the penguin belongs to:

- **Adelie**  
- **Chinstrap**  
- **Gentoo**

Along with the prediction, the app also displays the **probability** for each species, providing insight into the model’s confidence.

## 🧠 How It Works

The project uses a **Random Forest classifier** trained on the Palmer Penguins dataset.

### Model Training
- The dataset is cleaned and categorical features (`sex` and `island`) are encoded using **one-hot encoding**  
- The target variable (`species`) is mapped to numerical labels  
- A **Random Forest classifier** is trained on the processed dataset  
- The trained model is saved using **pickle** for later use in the web app  

### Prediction Pipeline
- User input is collected through a Streamlit sidebar  
- The input is combined with the original dataset to ensure consistent encoding  
- One-hot encoding is applied to match the model’s training format  
- The trained model is loaded and used to generate:
  - A species prediction  
  - Probability scores for each class
